**!!! PLEASE TAKE A READ OF THE LICENSE FILE FOR DETAILS ABOUT COPYRIGHT OWNERSHIP FOR THE CHARACTERS, ARTS, AND TEXT !!!**

This website contains my own characters' references as well as my friends', mostly those for whom I've commissioned gift arts of.

This website contains ONLY the characters' arts and descriptions about the characters' physical appearances, both of which are either SFW or suggestive (will be marked if so). I will NOT HOST any NSFW arts, even when the theme contains a way to add NSFW spoiler warning to images.

While theoretically & practically possible to put in other details like personalities and backgrounds, I will generally leave those out and provide them in other forms on a case-to-case basis. If there are any characters in this website with details like those aforementioned, they will be SFW in nature.

# Like the presentation?

If you like how the references are presented, you may follow the steps below to have your own OC's references being presented the same way too:

1) Read the following documentations and examples: <LINK>
    
2) Write your own .md file following the format laid out in step 1. If you need help, you can:
    - open an issue, or
    - contact me if you have existing contacts with me for help

3) There are two ways you can go:
    - Set up your own GitHub Pages by following [this](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/creating-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll) guide, OR
    - **(FOR FRIENDS ONLY)** Send me your .md file OR create a new pull request if you know what to do
        - If you follow this, this is where you stop
        - You can also ask me to help you write up the .md file with your instructions instead
    
4) Follow [this](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/adding-a-theme-to-your-github-pages-site-using-jekyll) guide to change your theme
    - Change it so that it's `remote_theme: dexirocks/<THEME_NAME>`

5) Add your previously made .md file


Voila! Your site should be up now.
