# Like the presentation?

If you like how the references are presented, you may follow the steps below to have your own OC's references being presented the same way too:

1) Read the following documentations and examples: <LINK>
    
2) Write your own .md file following the format laid out in step 1. If you need help, you can:
    - open an issue, or
    - contact me if you have existing contacts with me for help

3) There are two ways you can go:
    - Set up your own GitHub Pages by following [this](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/creating-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll) guide, OR
    - **(FOR FRIENDS ONLY)** Send me your .md file OR create a new pull request if you know what to do
        - If you follow this, this is where you stop
        - You can also ask me to help you write up the .md file with your instructions instead
    
4) Follow [this](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/adding-a-theme-to-your-github-pages-site-using-jekyll) guide to change your theme
    - Change it so that it's `remote_theme: dexirocks/<THEME_NAME>`

5) Add your previously made .md file


Voila! Your site should be up now.
